          <strong>Looking for events?</strong>
          Events@Penn hosts various events going on around Penn's campus and the
          Philly area. Search by date, or browse by organization or category. You
          don't need to have an account to look at events or organizations.

          <strong>Posting events?</strong>
          If you would like to host your organizations events on our platform,
          you must log in through your Facebook account using the button above.
          You will be prompted to log in and grant Events@Penn page viewing
          privileges. Next, navigate to the Organization tab, and choose to
          Add an Organization, which can be done either from scratch, or through

          page. If you create an organization through Facebook, all of your
          organization's past, present and future events will automatically
          populate into the platform.

          <strong>History:</strong>
          One piece of advice that The Daily Pennsylvanian frequently receives in
          annual surveys is that students want to access more up-to-date and
          consistent information about events that are happening on and around
          Penn's campus. In an effort to address this void in Penn student life,
          the DP has come together to create an events platform to consolidate
          events from a variety of sources in an easily accessible and comprehensive
          format.

        <p><strong>What are event categories?</strong></p>
        <p>
          Events are sorted by categories, which are set automatically when events are pulled from Facebook, or can be customized when you create an event. Event categories are distinguished by different colors, which are:
